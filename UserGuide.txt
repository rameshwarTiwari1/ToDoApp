User Guide: Running the Application Locally
1. Set Up the Backend (Server)

    Navigate to the server folder: Open your terminal or command prompt and change the directory to the server folder:

cd server

Install Backend Dependencies: Run the following command to install all the required dependencies for the backend:

npm install

Start the Server: Once the dependencies are installed, start the server by running:

    npm start 

    This will start the server on port 8000 by default. You should see a message indicating that the server is running.

2. Set Up the Frontend (Client)

    Navigate to the client folder: Open a new terminal window or tab and change the directory to the client folder:

cd client

Install Frontend Dependencies: Run the following command to install all the required dependencies for the frontend:

npm install

Start the Client: Once the dependencies are installed, start the React development server by running:

    npm start

    This will start the frontend on port 3000 by default.

3. Access the Application in the Browser

    After starting both the backend and frontend, open your browser and go to the following URLs:

        Frontend (React App):
        Open http://localhost:3000 to access the React app.

        Backend (API):
        The backend server is running on http://localhost:8000. You can test the API that are listed in routes in endpoint,
	folder using Postman or other tools.

4. Troubleshooting

    If you encounter issues, make sure both the frontend and backend are running in separate terminal windows.
    Ensure that the correct ports (3000 for the frontend and 8000 for the backend) are not being used by other applications.
